        <div class="item">
            <p style="font-size: xx-large">
                I am a bioengineering professional with hands-on experience spanning medical device research and development, product performance, and post-market surveillance. 
                I hold a Bachelor of Science in Bioengineering with a minor in History from Northeastern University and have worked across multidisciplinary teams in regulated 
                medical device environments, contributing to both early-stage development and in-market product support.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: xx-large">
                My most recent position was as a Project Performance Engineer at Abbott, where I investigated product complaints as part of the post-market surveillance team. 
                Additionally, I was responsible for  physical evaluations and functional testing of returned medical devices. 
                This role deepened my understanding of quality systems, root cause analysis, and the importance of clear technical documentation.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: xx-large">
                During my co-op experiences, I supported R&D teams at both Abbott and Suono Bio. 
                At  Abbott's Heart Failure division, I conducted blood compatibility testing on the HeartMate III pump,  designed and assembled prototypes in SolidWorks for human factors testing, and performed mechanical  testing on upcoming devices. 
                At Suono Bio, I created custom testing fixtures, executed animal and ex vivo tissue testing for ultrasonic drug delivery devices, and documented results in compliance with  established SOPs. 
                These experiences helped me grow both my technical lab and design skills.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: xx-large">
                In addition to industry experience, my academic projects emphasized data-driven problem solving and interdisciplinary collaboration.
                Notably, my capstone project involved developing a machine-learning algorithm in Python to assess thrombotic risk following revascularization surgery for patients with peripheral artery disease, incorporating both thromboelastography and baseline clinical data for a clinical research sponsor.
             Earlier coursework included hands-on design projects focused on biomedical instrumentation, implants, biomaterials, and biomechanics.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: xx-large">
                Technically, I am experienced with SolidWorks, AutoCAD, MATLAB, Python, Excel, and mechanical testing equipment, and I am comfortable working with precision instruments and laboratory systems. 
                I bring a methodical, detail-oriented approach to engineering problems, along with adaptability, receptiveness to feedback, and a strong commitment to continuous improvement. 
                I work well independently and collaboratively, particularly in environments that value cross-functional communication between engineering, research, and quality teams.
